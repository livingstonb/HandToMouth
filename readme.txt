Some of the code in the SCF and PSID directories was borrowed from Justin Weidner, the rest was written by Brian Livingston. 

The different dataset directories (GALLUP, NFCS, etc…) have a build directory that constructs the cleaned dataset and a stats directory that produces statistics. The ‘code’ directory in the root folder contains files used to help compute and plot hand-to-moouth statistics for the other directories.
